diceDB
====

A simple redis-compatible asynchronous in-memory key value store.

### NOTE:
This is just a learning implementation & not my original idea and is copied from
https://github.com/DiceDB/dice since I wanted to try what is takes to write your own database.

Thanks [Arpit Bhayani](https://github.com/arpitbbhayani) for an awesome project.
